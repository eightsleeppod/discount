High temperatures might be cooling down outside, but hot sleepers like me are still battling sweaty, restless nights. If you sleep hot, you know the struggle of waking up drenched in sweat and trying to cool off in the wee hours. So, what are we to do?

Switching to lighter bedding can only do so much when you're already unbearably hot. But there's a better solution. If you follow the wellness news cycle or health influencers like Andrew Huberman, you might already be familiar with the brand Eight Sleep. I've tested numerous cooling sheets, cooling pillows, cooling comforters and cooling mattresses. Yet none of those products come close to the icy feel of the Eight Sleep cover.

### What Is Eight Sleep?

For those unfamiliar with the premise of the Eight Sleep Pod, itâ€™s a smart mattress cover that fits over your mattress like a fitted sheet. It has built-in tubing through which water travels to cool or warm the bed's surface to keep your core body temperature optimized and sensors that track key sleep metrics. Those two things taken together are important because they link up to one another to work something like this: You hit the hay and the mattress sensors are constantly reading metrics like your heart rate and breathing. If you turn on the Autopilot feature via the app, for example, the AI-driven recommendations take the temperature up and down at different times during the night to help you wake up feeling refreshed
